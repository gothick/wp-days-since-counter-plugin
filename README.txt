Displays a count of days since a certain day on the Edit Post admin page.

== Description ==

A trivial plugin to show a count of the number of days since a certain date on the Create New/Edit Post
page in the WordPress admin interface. I found this useful when doing a photo-a-day-for-a-year blogging
project, as I always knew how many days I was through my year when posting a new picture.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `days-since-counter` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
