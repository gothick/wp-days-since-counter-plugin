Displays a count of days since a certain day on the Edit Post admin page.

== Description ==

A trivial plugin to show a count of the number of days since a certain date on the Create New/Edit Post
page in the WordPress admin interface. I found this useful when doing a photo-a-day-for-a-year blogging
project, as I always knew how many days I was through my year when posting a new picture.

You'll find the Days Since Counter settings under Settings/Days Since Counter in the WordPress
admin menus. Choose a start date and hit "Save". Then whenever you create or edit a Post, you'll
find a new "meta box" on the editing page showing the number of days since your configured date.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `days-since-counter` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
